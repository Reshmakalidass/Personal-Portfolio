# Personal-Portfolio
A fully responsive personal portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project highlights my professional profile, technical skills, and academic projects with smooth scrolling, animated UI components (AOS), and a clean dark-themed design. Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices and deployed using GitHub Pages.
